#Couch to WPPro

##What is it?

Couch to WPPro is a tutorial series that covers WordPress Theme Development _for beginners_, and in this repository is the theme that we create during it.

##Requirements

To complete the series, you only need an internet connection and computer, and ideally some HTML and CSS knowledge, we cover the rest in the series. The theme, WPPro, is built using [Flatstrap](https://github.com/littlesparkvt/flatstrap), a take on [Twitter's Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) by [littlesparkvt](http://littlesparkvt.com). It's a more minimal approach
