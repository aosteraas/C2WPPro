##Requirements

To complete the series, you only need an internet connection and computer, and ideally some HTML and CSS knowledge, we introduce the rest in the series.

##The WPPro Theme

WPPro is built using [Flatstrap](https://github.com/littlesparkvt/flatstrap), a take on [Twitter's Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) by [littlesparkvt](http://littlesparkvt.com), a more minimal, flatter approach.

##Theme Zips

By popular demand, the theme per each part of the series is available in a zip file.
